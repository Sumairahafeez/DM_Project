## Individual Contribution and Planning

The team members of this group are Sumaira Hafeez (2023-CS-01) and Muhammad Ayyan Goreja (2023-CS-05). In this project, Muhammad Ayyan Goreja contributed to writing programs of Part-A, Question number 1a, and prepared the slides for video demonstration. Sumaira Hafeez wrote programs for Number Theory Questions, Question 1b, and submitted the report. Overall, the project was completed by the contributions and efforts of both members.

## Part A

### Question 1a: Game Models

#### Mario Kart
- **Race Track Graph:** Modeling the racecourse using nodes and edges to represent different features and possible paths.
- **Item Usage Graph:** Modeling item interactions and strategies during the race.

#### Among Us
- **Player Movement Graph:** Analyzing player movements within the game environment.
- **Impostor Strategy Graph:** Understanding optimal strategies for impostors and potential counter-strategies by crewmates.

### Question 1b: Tic-Tac-Toe as a Graph

#### Introduction
- Explains the representation of Tic-Tac-Toe game using graphs.
- Different views and visual features are discussed.

### Question 2: Graph Operations

- Finding undirected and directed graph degrees.
- Checking for bipartiteness.
- Creating adjacency, edge listing adjacency, and incidence matrices.

## Part B

### Number Theory Operations
